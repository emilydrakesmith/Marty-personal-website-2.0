### About

A work in progress!  Previously I built a simple front-end Quiz App using jQuery.  Always linking the design but feeling this would be better realized with back-end processing and CRUD functionality, I'm currently redeveloping it to work with a Python back-end married to a React front-end.  The links go to the original completed project but the new work in progress is in my GitHub as well.
