### About

The second iteration of my website built to showcase my portfolio projects, centralize links to the various places around the web that make up my digital footprint, and make it easy for anyone to contact me.  I decided to use a bold design and build the project from scratch with an SSG rather than using a CSS framework.  This is replacing my old website which was coded entirely in HTML & CSS and I'm proud to show how far I've come.
