# Instructions for Use

### Navigating the Website

This website is relatively easy to navigate given its nature being mostly informational.  Desktop users have access to quick links to all the main sub-directories in the directory `/` (main index page).  There are also nav links in the page header visible on all pages.  Mobile users will see a hamburger menu rather to display the same links.  The hamburger menu is fixed to the top of the screen and will not disappear if the page is scrolled.  The page is fully keyboard navigable on the desktop version.

### Notes for Developers

If you fork the code for my website there are some things that you should be aware of before doing so.  Presumably if you want to fork my code, you want to preserve and work with my architecture rather than delete it.

**First some non-technical stuff:**
* This page is published under the [MIT License](#license) and all of its terms extend to use of my code and design.
* If you fork my code I would like to be recognized prominenetly in the first section of your `README.md` file with a link to `martysmith.tech` or `www.martysmith.tech` depending on which I'm using.  This is under the principle of please don't be a jerk if reusing my work.

**Config files:**
* The `gatsby-ssr.js` and `gatsby-browser.js` files apply the `<Layout>` wrapper to every page on the website.
* The `gatsby-node.js` file feeds data from `src/data` into template functions to generate all sub-directories in the `/resources` and `/projects` URL pathways.  This file retrieves minimal information to determine the pages which need to be generated, then the template functions coding those pages retrieve more detailed data.
* Plugins I'm using in `gatsby-config.js` generally serve three purposes:
  1. make images in the `/src/images` directory available for GraphQL
  2. make `.md` data in the `/src/data` available for `gatsby-node.js` and GraphQL
  3. activate *React Helmet* which allows me to populate data into my website's `<Head>` component

**Data:**
* All of my images exist at a `640Ã—640` pixel resolution.  Various pages in my website will resize them to smaller sizes using the `gatsby-image` plugin.  The size is somewhat arbitrary, it simply needs to be larger than I will presumably use images on my site and in the same aspect ratio (currently `1:1`).
* All individual project pages in the `/projects` URL pathway are rendered using data from individual `.md` files in the `/src/data/projects` directory which is fed into the template file `project-details.js`.  To make new files, copy/paste data from an existing file into a new one and update the data.  Please note that I have the sequence coded into the `.md` frontmatter.  Achieving a custom sort sequence requires either this or hardcoding a sequence into the `projects.js` file.  I chose the former.  This does require however updating a number of files to avoid conflicts.
* All individual resource pages in the `/resources` URL pathway are rendered using data from the collection of `.md` files in a given folder of the `/src/data/resources` directory which is fed into the template file `resource-details.js`.  That is, the collection resources listed in the page at a URL pathway `/resources/foo-bar` would be generated from data in each of the individual files `.md` files in the `/src/data/resources/foo-bar.js` directory.

**Architecture:**
* Each of the main URL pathways in the website (`/`, `/about`, `/projects`, `/resources`, `/contact`) are coded by a file in the `/src/pages` directory.  The central index page is `index.js`; Gatsby creates namespaces for all other files according to their filename.
* The page `/projects` is coded by a file `index.js` in the `/src/pages/projects` directory.  This architecture is necessary to add pages at sub-directories in that URL pathway and I plan to add a page at `/resources/other-projects` at a later date.  Note that creating sub-directory pages does not require this architecture if the pages are being generated from template files.  The functions in `gatsby-node.js` will take care of that.

#### v 2.2.2.0  |  06 July 2021  |  commit 0ec1445329957bc8d5eb33146f044f81139223db
* Added mobile-responsiveness to `/resources` sub-directory pages.  Not perfected yet but definitely good enough to push to production.
* Disabled *JavaScript* and *React* links on the `/resources` index page.  I don't have data ready for them yet so they aren't rendering properly.  I don't want to stop them from letting me push to production.
* **Edit** Build failed at the GraphQL query in `resource-details.js`, now time to figure out why.

#### v 2.2.2.0  |  12 July 2021  |  commit 34c38188cbfcc3e3ad6c0982309dd7f7db484a9e
* I disabled all links in the `/resources` index page except for *Web Development*.  I'm wondering if the build is failing because I'm running queries for pages that don't yet have content.  Edit: Not it.  At least not the only issue.  I'm leaving it like this for now though just for the sake of simplicity.

#### v 2.2.2.0  |  12 July 2021  |  commit 411197eb73a97b8e0b76bdc59ef580e1f38a6a99
* I disabled the code to render images in `resource-details.js` currently at line 35: `<Img fluid={node.frontmatter.squareImg.childImageSharp.fluid} />`
  * Netlify says the error exists both here and at the query, but disabling it here will eliminate at least one complicating factor.

#### v 2.2.2.0  |  13 July 2021  |  commit 072d871b84d4177a34bd5c87792718ef65c62a38
* I did not anticipate in the last commit my website would now build, but without the images in question.  I restored the previous line of code removed, but now I need to finish this fix tonight or else my site will be live with missing images.
  * For the time being I've locked Netlify into using the last successful build.  Auto-publishing is disabled.

#### v 2.2.2.0  |  13 July 2021  |  commit 78646c32aaf32b92648a43a0a12caa920ef7a960
* I moved the empty `.md` files from the directory `/src/data/resources/web-development` to `/src/data/resources/tempfiles` in case their presence is the reason the build is failing.  It's probably not but their presence is an unnecessary complicating factor.
* Redeveloped GraphQL query in `resource-details.js` from scratch.

#### v 2.2.2.0  |  13 July 2021  |  commit e5448edc1e620c83ea42ae4bc609f3272092b240
* I changed image sharp fluid to image sharp fixed in `resource-details.js` to see if a fixed inquiry will work.
  * Edit: Nope, fixed doesn't work either.

#### v 2.2.2.0  |  13 July 2021  |  commit 6c3ef5b27867457774cdfd6fcbc4a943201ce651
* Registered the new plugin `gatsby-plugin-image` in `gatsby-config.js`; this replaces the plugin `gatsby-image` (which is now deprecated).  Installed via `npm i gatsby-plugin-image` in the terminal.
* Ran the codemod via `npx gatsby-codemods gatsby-plugin-image /Users/martinsmith/code/personal-projects/Marty-personal-website/Marty-Smith-personal-website-2/src/templates` to update code.
* Restructured how I call images in `project-details.js` to reflect the new file structure returned by GraphQL.

#### v 2.2.2.0  |  13 July 2021  |  commit b3358bd96057ed8d47cc4735acb522a582520a4a
* Deleted placeholder test files in `src/data/resources/javascript` and `src/data/resources/react`.  I think the build on Netlify may have failed due to incomplete data files being skipped by the build in my local environment.
  * **FUTURE REFERENCE** *This was it!*  So from now on, no half-built `.md` files.  Every created file needs to be blank or fully-built.  Two test files with half-developed dummy data failed to build because of the missing data.

#### v 2.2.2.1  |  13 July 2021  |  commit 8c567e73516c3a688181d0ae3be6425cc4de6dd9
* Moved all `.md` files being stored in the `/src/data/resources/tempfiles` directory to the `/src/data/resources/web-development` directory.
* Re-activated the link to the `/resources/html-css` sub-directory page.

#### v 2.2.2.2  |  13 July 2021  |  commit 115de568ab74484f4b4f9d85758fcb525c34ad65  |  Current Version
* Built out `.md` files for the following links in the `/resources/web-development` sub-directory page:
  * [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
  * [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)
  * [Lunapic](https://www.lunapic.com/)

#### v 2.2.3.0  |  13 July 2021  |  commit 55b82cdcfd9efab0294c8be3b60021afc6dc3a9c
* Added a field `slug` to the frontmatter in all `.md` files in the `src/data/resources` directory.  This is necessary for anchor tags for in-page hyperlinking.
* Added  `id={node.frontmatter.slug}` as an attribute to the top-level element `<article>` in `resource-details.js` to have a target for in-page hyperlinking.
* Added `className={styles.resource_external_hyperlink}` as an attribute to external link anchor tags in `resource-details.js` file.
* Refactor CSS in `resource-details.module.css` such that styles previously targeting `.resource_article_details a` now target the new `resource_external_hyperlink` class.
* Added in-page hyperlinks to every resource listed in the `/resources` sub-directories which name another resource.
* Added additional `margin-bottom` spacing to external hyperlinks in `/resources` sub-directories for mobile devices.
* Added alt text to all instances of `<GatsbyImage />` to satisfy errors.
* Built out `.md` files for the following links in the `/resources/html-css` sub-directory page:
  * [CSS Tricks - Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
  * [CSS Tricks - Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
  * [Layoutit](https://grid.layoutit.com/)

#### v 2.2.3.1  |  13 July 2021  |  commit 46b8a49d66d9b76fb9131c73ba6241b215145e53
* Updated items listed in *Ice Box* section of `README.md` to reflect implemented features.
* Added the MIT License to the publication and use terms of this website.

#### BRANCH render-layout-through-ssr  |  13 July 2021  |  commit 65a45be3b9aafac772918da7355742de8e5aeef0
* Initialized `gatsby-ssr.js` and `gatsby-browser.js` files.
* Wrote functions in both new files to automatically wrap `<Layout />` around page elements.
* Removed `<Layout />` wrapper from all render functions and corresponding import statements from relevant files.
* Confirmed all pages including sub-directories are rendering properly.

#### v 2.2.4.0  |  13 July 2021  |  commit 5fd9b1e3c46706015f348967cbb57de1c5af804f
* Pushed branch `render-layout-through-ssr` and merged into main on GitHub.
* Pulled this commit from GitHub to sync local `main` with `origin/main`.

#### v 2.2.4.1  |  15 July 2021  |  commit 99c641bf72ebab5b91f2cd4831aa42b809c987a8
* Removed an unnecessary `<div>` wrapper around the `<Link />` elements in the `index.js` page.
* Added an `.md` file for [Making CSS](https://makingcss.com/) to be rendered in the `/resources/html-css` directory.
* Added .`md` files for [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to be rendered in the `/resources/web-development` directory.
* *Important!* since I don't seem to be using wide images in my links to external resources, I've stopped creating them when I make new resource entries.  For the time being I'm keeping the `wideImg` field in the frontmatter of new `.md` files but leaving it set to `null`.  I'm going to keep the field and the existing wide images until a later time when I'm sure I'll never use them.  I don't think they look as good as the square screenshots anyway.
* Made alterations to the organization of the `src/images/resources` directory:
  * Deleted the directory `src/images/resources/internal` since I'm not using it.
  * Moved all the files in the `src/images/resources/external` directory to `src/images/resources` since I don't have sub-directories in that directory anymore.
  * Deleted the directory `src/images/resources/external` as it's now empty and obsolete.
  * Updated all the image filepaths in `.md` files in the `src/data/resources` directory.  This was easy since it's just removing `/external` from each filepaths.
* Modified `resource-details.module.css` to use color-match in-page links with external links.
* Hyperlinked records in *Version Notes* of `README.md` of adding external resources to `/resources` sub-directories.

#### v 2.2.4.2  |  15 July 2021  |  commit ec6b75c83edd2817c34c86a70c6ec4cfefd4c1de
* Updated data in `heroku.md` file; I copy/pasted data from `netlify.md` as a template but forgot to update the `html` data (resource description and in-page hyperlink) in the file.
* Added an `.md` file for [GitHub](https://github.com/) to be rendered in the `/resources/web-development` directory.

#### v 2.2.4.3  |  15 July 2021  |  commit a0765382b14575734a33fd688030dc025eadcee4
* Added an `.md` file for [Bacon Ipsum](https://baconipsum.com/) to be rendered in the `/resources/web-development` directory.
* Created a new *Learning* resource in the `/resources` directory.
* Moved the following `.md` files for the following resources from `src/data/resources/web-development` to `src/data/resources/tutorials`:
  * [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
  * [CSS Tricks](https://www.css-tricks.com/)
  * [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)
  * [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg)

#### v 2.2.4.4  |  15 July 2021  |  commit 21830608745276f775d9d12c42e8cb2c777303cf
* Refactored `gatsby-browser.js` and `gatsby-ssr.js` to use arrow function notation.
* Added alt-text to icons loaded in the `/resources` index page.

#### v 2.2.4.5  |  17 July 2021  |  commit 4d1d461d4be27ce570c960d34160b39968d8e65b
* Removed the `pageTitle` field from the frontmatter of all `.md` files in the `src/data/resources` directory.  This field is unnecessary due to the switch statement I built into the `resource-details.js` file.
* Removed all instances of the `break` operatory from the switch statement in the `resource-details.js` file.  It isn't necessary for how I built the statement.
* Activated the `/resources/react` sub-directory and built out `.md` files for the following resources:
  * [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
  * [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
  * [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
  * [React - Net Ninja Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d)
  * [React - GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
  * [React Hooks - Eric Bishard article](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/react-hooks-guide/)
* Activated the `/resources/gatsby-js` sub-directory and built out `.md` files for the following resources:
  * [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
  * [Gatsby - Net Ninja Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hw1g77I35ZivVLe8k2nvjB)
* Updated several instances of typing `Gatsby.js` to read `GatsbyJS` throughout the website.

#### v 2.2.4.6  |  17 July 2021  |  commit 7a8385570939e45ef0e08aae2468f8f544b12e42
* Reinstated the `break` operators in the switch statement in the `resource-details.js` file removed in the previous commit.  I actually did need them.  Oops.
* Added a `sequence` value to the frontmatter of all `.md` files in the `src/data/resources` directory to allow in-page sorting of GraphQL query returns.
* Updated GraphQL query in `resource-details.js` to sort returns by the new `sequence` value.

#### v 2.2.4.6  |  19 July 2021  |  commit 28de1564ca3cc4ddad5bb7fcc2d48dedeb18100e
* **Bugfix!**  When I refactored the `<main>` nav links to remove the unnecessary wrapper in `index.js` I lost vertical spacing between the squares on mobile devices.  I added `margin-bottom: 28px;` styling to a `.nav_links > a` CSS selector under a `@media (max-width: 620px)` media query.  Now spacing is proper.

#### v 2.2.4.6  |  19 July 2021 |  commit 95487bf8bf2b9614c4b8ac841578c95ae2122303
* Built a *Table of Contents* in the `README.md` file.

#### v 2.2.5.0  |  19 July 2021 |  commit afeec54eb0348e20eb3ddf02ddfc6cb1c47ae7f1
* Built a *Instructions for Use* section in the `README.md` file.

#### v 2.2.5.0  |  19 July 2021 |  commit cccee8b2add38e3ebf92c273958f1e0c4144b227
* Added a version note for commit `afeec54eb0348e20eb3ddf02ddfc6cb1c47ae7f1` (ie the commit immediately before this one).  I got excited and pushed my code without doing so.  Oops.

#### v 2.2.5.1  |  17 August 2021 |  commit 27b3ab2fa675d7d62725247b5a0ff1eea152c90d
* Refactored the `LeftSidenav.js` component to map over an array of data to produce links instead of hardcoding them.

#### v 2.2.5.2  |  17 August 2021 |  commit e9e23019d918db6751d72f94072f5a41ac8284fe
* Add my personal e-mail address to site metadata in the `gatsby-config.js` file.
* Remove all instances of hardcoding `marty.smith01@yahoo.com` and load it from site metadata instead:
  * pages: `index.js` and `contact.js`
  * component: `RightSidenav.js`

#### v 2.2.5.3  |  18 August 2021  |  commit 96ee1b0666812be0fbbdc4088170271ec42a7264
* Added "TypeScript" to *Key Skills* section of the `about.js` page (mobile and desktop versions).
* Added a link to *Pinterest* in the `LeftSidenav.js` component.

#### v 2.2.5.3  |  18 August 2021  |  commit c0095152d240dca50cda20282f82c7546c9ba707
* Removed the `useStaticQuery` GraphQL dongle from `index.js` and `contact.js` files where it wasn't needed.

#### v 2.2.5.4  |  04 September 2021  |  commit --  |  Current Version
* Changed my home city as listed in `index.js` to Raleigh-Durham.
* Added `<meta>` tags to React Helmet for `author` and `description` content fields.
  * Data lives in `siteMetadata` of the `gatsby-config.js` file and is imported through GraphQL.

# Tech Framework

### Tech Stack

#### This app uses:
* React & Gatsby.js SSG
* JavaScript ES6+
* HTML5 & CSS3

#### I built this app using:

#### This app is hosted at:
* [Link to GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mhsmith321/Marty-personal-website-2.0)

### Plugins & Dongles

#### [React Helmet](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/add-page-metadata/)
* Allows metadata to be customized in `<head>` section of rendered website.
* Install via `npm install gatsby-plugin-react-helmet react-helmet`
* Import to relevant react pages/components via `import {Helmet} from 'react-helmet'`
* Inside JSX, code a `<Helmet>` container and inside it code any items that would normally be in the `<head>`
* Dependency as listed in `package.json`: `"gatsby-plugin-react-helmet": "^4.7.1"`
* Plugin as registered in `gatsby-config.js`: `'gatsby-plugin-react-helmet'` (no configuration)
* [Full documentation is available here.](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)

#### [Gatsby Source Filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/)
* Allows Gatsby to use GraphQL to query information out of the React file structure (images, `.txt` and `.md` files, etc).
* Install via `npm install gatsby-source-filesystem`
* Needs to be once for each directory which will be queried.
* Register: `resolve: gatsby-source-filesystem`
* Configure: `options: {}` which takes multiple key/values:
  * `` name: `projects` `` (any string for `sameple`, can be referenced with GraphQL)
  * `` path: `${__dirname}/src/data/projects/` ``  (any path in the `/src` directory)

#### [Gatsby Plugin Manifest](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/performance/add-a-manifest-file/)
* Allows the creation of a web manifest plugin in `gatsby-config.js`
  * Technically web manifests are used to score progressive web apps and are not necessary for apps that are not intended to be downloaded to and installed on an Android device.
  * I'm building one here as practice, to have a template for future projects, and to future-proof this project should more browsers start to utilize web manifests.
* Install via `npm install gatsby-plugin-manifest`
* Link in the `<head>` with `<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json" />` (in this case, inside `<Helmet>`, refer to *React Helmet* for more info).
* Must be registered and configured in `plugins` in `gatsby-config.js`
  * Register: `resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-manifest'`
  * Configure: `options: {}` (see [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) and [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json) for keys).
* Only `name`, `version`, and `manifest_version` are mandatory keys; all others are optional.
  * `name` name of the app
  * `background-color` background color of the app, should correspond to CSS
  * `categories` see [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/categories) for a list of current categories
  * `description` description of the app's purpose and core function
  * `icon` links the site favicons and provides basic metadata about each
  * `lang` [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) for the app's language (`en-US` === American English)
  * `orientation` preferred screen orientation for viewing the app
  * `short_name` short version of the app name < 12 characters
  * `shortcuts` main directories in the website's architecture
  * For some reason keys and values which are strings must be written with double-quotes (single-quotes will throw errors).
* [Full documentation is available here.](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-manifest/?=gatsby-plugin-manifest)

# Future Plans

### Short Term
* Continue building out more sections of this `README.md` file.
  * *Instructions for Use*, minimal since this page is informational only
  * *Developer Notes* with information about file structure, interesting bits of code, etc
    * incorporate into *Tech Framework*?
  * *Contribute* with license info, permission to reuse, and my own contact information
  * *Screenshots* page (instructional video too?)
* Consider a `/src/notes` directory with `.txt` files to hold larger bodies of text that don't warrant full markdown-syntax pages.  This will greatly simplify updating content text on the website.
* Topics and sub-topics for *Resources* page (sub-topics in `.md` files):
  * General Web Dev Stuff
    * Icon Scout
  * JavaScript
    * Higher-Order Function Reference Page
  * React/Gatsby
    * Net Ninja: React
    * Net Ninja: Gatsby
  * Node
* Generate in-page hyperlinking in `/resources` sub-directories to utilize frontmatter data rather than hardcoding into HTML section.

### Ice Box
* Consider generating the element `<main>` inside pages loaded to the `<Layout />` component instead of hardcoded inside it.
  * Each page loaded into `<Layout />` needs to have a top-level `<div>`.  Can't use fragments `<> </>` because I need the top-level `<div>` to have a class for styling purposes.  This feels like an unnecessary wrapper.
* Split projects into two buckets, *Main* and *Other*.
  * Main projects will be shown on the `/projects` main index page and linked at `/projects/project-name`
  * The final link div on the `/projects` index page will be *Other Projects* with an icon.  This will go to another index page at `/projects/other` listing minor projects not central to my portfolio.
  * The *Other Projects* page may be a single page or it may display links in the same manner as the `/projects` index page and link to projects at `/projects/other/project-name` if that doesn't cause problems for Gatsby.* Add mobile-responsiveness to the design.  This will be a goal for shortly after I reach MVP.
* Add Google Maps to `/contact` page.  Before doing this I need to decide where to deploy my site and see how they configure hidden data (in this case an API key).  [See here for more information.](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-googlemaps-static/)
* Add Google Analytics to the website.  This should be relatively easy since I already have it set up for my site's previous version.

<a id='special-thanks'></a>

# Special Thanks
* I built this website with Gatsby.js, a free single-site generator resource.  I used the [Hello World](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world) starter page which is intended as a truly "blank slate" layout.
* This is my first independent Gatsby.js project.  To learn Gatsby I've followed [the extensive documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) from [the creators](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/about/) as well as the free [Net Ninja Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qms4k6y7OgI&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hw1g77I35ZivVLe8k2nvjB) series on YouTube created by the [Net Ninja Shaun](https://github.com/iamshaunjp).
* This is also my first new project after graduating from [General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/) program.  I'd like to thank my instructors Ben Manley, David Stinson, and Shahzad Khan for their outstanding leadership as well as other graduates from the SEIR-EC-2-22 cohort.
* Developing a color pallate involved the extensive use of [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), a free resource created by [Fabrizio Bianchi](http://fabrizio.io/) and checked with [ColorSafe](http://colorsafe.co/) for WCAG-compliant contrast ratios to ensure accessibility.
* I created my favicon for free with the help of [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/), a free utility built by [John Sorrentino](https://twitter.com/johnsorrentino).
* Logos for [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja/playlists) are re-used with permission from Shaun Pelling, conferred over Twitter.
* Formatting this `README.md` file was easy with the help of the [Markdown Live Preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) tool and GitHub Guide's [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) page.
* I inserted metadata into my page's `<head>` using [React Helmet](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/add-page-metadata/), a free utility created and maintained by [the NFL](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet).
* The icons used on this site were acquired free from [flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/) with permission to use so long as proper attribution is provided in documentation.

# Planning & Development Notes

* I want this to be a React app in the style of a single-page app.  I'm using Gatsby both to learn the technology and for the inherent benefits of a static-site generator as well as the relative ease of building out a site, chiefly search-engine optimization and speed for the user.  An SSG is optimal for a site that benefits from back-end processessing but has no use for CRUD functionality.

* I'm planning to use a dark theme that uses bold rather than light colors.  I've decided to use a pride color theme.  [I developed my color palette and saved it to Repl.it here.](https://replit.com/@mhsmith321/personal-website-color-scheme)

* I'm currently planning five pages/pathways:
  1. Splash page => `/` (index page at martysmith.tech)
       * This will be the main splash page users land on.
       * It will have little functionality aside from a brief introduction and nav to other pages.
  2. About => `/about`
       * This page will have my picture and personal/professional information about me.
  4. Projects => `/projects`
       * There will be an index page for this directory and sub-directories.
       * The index page will have links to my major portfolio pieces.
       * Each major portfolio piece will have its own page in the sub-directory.
       * Should I have an entry for this website?
       * There will also be an *Other Projects* sub-directory with minor projects I want people to see, but don't consider central works.
  5. Contact => `/contact`
       * All my essential contact information I'm ok publishing to the internet.
       * Google maps showing Columbia, SC?
       * This will be redundant with the same information elsewhere, but I'm ok with that.
  6. Resources => `/resources`
       * I want to have a page linking to my favorite web dev/engineering resources around the internet.
       * I'll need to see if this is a single page or if it needs sub-directories based on how much stuff I want to list.
       * Include a note to contact me if my resource listings are out of date.

* Optimally I'd like every page to fully render on a user's monitor with no scrolling.  This may be ambitious but this is the goal.

* I plan to have a single `<Layout>` wrapper around every page.

* I don't think I'll need any conditional formatting here except for screen sizes and link clicks.

* Since this site is primarily meant for professional recruiters and HR professionals who are presumably using desktop workstations, I'm not planning to use mobile-first design.  That said, I do intend to add mobile-responsiveness once I reach MVP.  This should be relatively easy using CSS Grid.
